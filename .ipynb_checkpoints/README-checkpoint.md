# **Apta-MCTS**
Supporting code for the paper **"Predicting aptamer sequences that interact with target proteins using Aptamer-Protein Interaction classifiers and a Monte-Carlo tree search approach"**(currently being prepared).

### Aptamer-Protein-Interaction (API) classifiers
Implementations of how to train the Aptamer-Protein Interaction classifier using Random Forest are described in a `classifier.py`. The trained models are separated as two-versions according to the dataset that trained. The benchmark datasets are available in the `datasets/` folder with json format files.
